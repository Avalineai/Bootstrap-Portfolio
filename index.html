    <p class="bio">I was born in Beijing, China, and immigrated here with my parents and twin sister in 1994. In 1995, my parents welcomed our baby sister, who recently completed studies at U.C. Davis. Growing up in America as a small child was a new and emotional change for me; I experienced a lot of culture shock on top of family dysfunction, but eventually San Diego, California became my home. My dad, my twin, and I were Naturalized in 2003, so I have a neat rarely seen certificate showing I'm an American. I don't get to visit my family back in China much, but my twin keeps in touch with everyone for us both.</p>

            As a young adult, I was the shy, awkward nerd girl, and spent my days watching anime, reading manga, and drawing. Though I don't do any of those things now, I have developed quite a talent for painting as a hobby, and plan to launch a YouTube channel soon. I didn't have much of a fashion sense back then, and did not have the luxury of making my own clothing choices so I was the definition of the phrase: "your mother dresses you funny." I got a much better grasp of what looks good on me as I got older, but sometimes I question "fashion" when I look at price tags at Bloomingdale's. Thankfully with time and social media make-up tutorials, I am now more confident and less awkward. I even drive strangers in my car through rideshare (Uber/Lyft) but sometimes there can be unavoidable awkward moments. Currently I have embarked on an exciting journey learning about web development, personal growth, and e-commerce and digital marketing.</p>
